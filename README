Grove Dust sensor(Shinyei PPD42NS) and Raspberry Pi
---------------------------------------------------

This project demonstrates how to monitor the air quality in an environment by
measuring the dust concentration with the Grove Dust sensor(Shinyei PPD42NS)
connected to Raspberry Pi.
Results are pretty similar to a setup where the Grove Dust sensor is connected
to the digital input port N8 on Arduino Uno.

Dust concentration is measured in pcs/0.01cf and μg/m3. AQI (Air quality index)
is also calculated for direct comparison with data on http://aqicn.org.

To run the project:

git clone

make test
./test

OR

make test_async
./test_async

lngpio provides two APIs:

1. synchronous API with a pulseIn alike function, ./test uses that one
2. asyncronous API with callbacks, ./test_async demontrates how to use it

No third-party software is required to run the application.

Example output:

161.748291 pcs/0.01cf, 0.252226 μg/m3, 1 AQI
510.323608 pcs/0.01cf, 0.795786 μg/m3, 3 AQI
696.272583 pcs/0.01cf, 1.085750 μg/m3, 4 AQI
523.159485 pcs/0.01cf, 0.815802 μg/m3, 3 AQI
324.386963 pcs/0.01cf, 0.505841 μg/m3, 2 AQI
424.624207 pcs/0.01cf, 0.662149 μg/m3, 2 AQI
131.289444 pcs/0.01cf, 0.204730 μg/m3, 0 AQI
715.067444 pcs/0.01cf, 1.115059 μg/m3, 4 AQI

The Shinyei sensor is connected to the GPIO on the Raspberry Pi in the following
manner:

1) Red wire to Pin 2(5V)
2) Black wire to Pin 6(GND)
3) Black wire to a 3k resistor which on the other end is connected to Pin 11
(GPIO17)
4) Pin 11(GPIO17) to a 2k resistor which on the other end connects to Yellow
wire
