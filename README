Grove Dust sensor(Shinyei PPD42NS) and Raspberry Pi
---------------------------------------------------

This project demonstrates how to monitor/visualize the air quality in an
environment by measuring the dust concentration with the Grove Dust sensor(Shinyei
PPD42NS) connected to Raspberry Pi.
Results are pretty similar to a setup where the Grove Dust sensor is connected
to the digital input port N8 on Arduino Uno.

Dust concentration is measured in pcs/0.01cf and μg/m3. AQI (Air quality index)
is also calculated for direct comparison with data on http://aqicn.org.

Example installation:

Fine particle (PM2.5) in Lund, Sweden, Live data
http://ogy.noip.me:3456/scripts/airquality.py
http://ogy.noip.me:3456/scripts/plot_airquality.py

To run the project:

git clone

make test
./test

OR

make test_async
./test_async

OR

make test_mysql
./test_mysql

./test_mysql stores data into a MySQL database so that it can be later retrieved
and plotted for example. For the test app to work set up the database in the
following way:

mysql -h localhost -u root -ppass
mysql> CREATE DATABASE AirQuality;
mysql> use AirQuality;
mysql> CREATE TABLE ParticlePM25 (concentration_pcs FLOAT, \
    concentration_ugm3 FLOAT, aqi INT, ts_created TIMESTAMP);
mysql> quit
Bye

For plotting/displaying the result in a browser, look at plot/README

All test applications use lngpio which is part of the project, it provides two
APIs for reading the GPIO:

1. synchronous API with a pulseIn alike function, ./test uses that one
2. asyncronous API with callbacks, ./test_async demontrates how to use it

No third-party software is required to run the applications.

Example output (./test && ./test_async):

161.748291 pcs/0.01cf, 0.252226 μg/m3, 1 AQI
510.323608 pcs/0.01cf, 0.795786 μg/m3, 3 AQI
696.272583 pcs/0.01cf, 1.085750 μg/m3, 4 AQI
523.159485 pcs/0.01cf, 0.815802 μg/m3, 3 AQI
324.386963 pcs/0.01cf, 0.505841 μg/m3, 2 AQI
424.624207 pcs/0.01cf, 0.662149 μg/m3, 2 AQI
131.289444 pcs/0.01cf, 0.204730 μg/m3, 0 AQI
715.067444 pcs/0.01cf, 1.115059 μg/m3, 4 AQI

The Shinyei sensor is connected to the GPIO on the Raspberry Pi in the following
manner:

1) Red wire to Pin 2(5V)
2) Black wire to Pin 6(GND)
3) Black wire to a 3k resistor which on the other end is connected to Pin 11
(GPIO17)
4) Pin 11(GPIO17) to a 2k resistor which on the other end connects to Yellow
wire
