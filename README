Grove Dust sensor(Shinyei PPD42NS) and a Raspberry Pi
-----------------------------------------------------

This project demonstrates how to monitor the air quality in an environment by
measuring the dust concentration with the Grove Dust sensor(Shinyei PPD42NS)
connected to Raspberry Pi.

To run the project:

git clone
make test
./test

Dust concentration is measured in pcs/0.01cf and Î¼g/m3.

The Shinyei sensor is connected to the GPIO on the Raspberry Pi in the following
manner:

Red wire to Pin 2(5V)
Black wire to Pin 6(GND)
Black wire to a 3k3 resistor which on the other end is connected to Pin 7(GPIO4)
Pin 7(GPIO4) to a 1k2 resistor which on the other end connects to Yellow wire
